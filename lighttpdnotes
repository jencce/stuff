As indicating in src/Makefile:
am__lighttpd_SOURCE_DIST points out binary lighttpd's source code files.
main in the server.c.

tip: How do you find this?
grep list by order: listen network_init.. server_init
# better idea: grep getopt ..


src/server.c 808 network_init

       O_CLOEXEC (Since Linux 2.6.23)
              Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new file descriptor.  Speci-
              fying  this  flag  permits  a program to avoid additional fcntl(2)
              F_SETFD operations to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag.  Additionally,  use
              of  this  flag  is  essential in some multithreaded programs since
              using a separate fcntl(2) F_SETFD operation to set the  FD_CLOEXEC
              flag  does  not  suffice to avoid race conditions where one thread
              opens a file descriptor at the same time as another thread does  a
              fork(2) plus execve(2).
