1/ export option "secure/insecure"  and mount.nfs option "resvport/noresvport"

By default, nfs clients are only allowed to request through previliged ports,
which is less then 1024, so default options are former ones.
If you want to request via prots large then 1024, both server and client need
options.

2/ export nfs via other ports OR change nfsd listen port
change /etc/sysconfig/nfs add this : RPCNFSDARGS="-p 2078"
Also, this may depend on nfs service start scripts, find the place where add
options to nfsd
