fs/nfsd is nfs server kernel implemention.

nfsd start from fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c, module nfsd_init

nfsd create and mount a procfs mount as user interface:
	sunrpc on /proc/fs/nfsd type nfsd (rw,relatime)

Writing a positive integer to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads will start
the nfsd service, and zero to stop.
