trap [-lp] [[arg] sigspec ...]
              The  command  arg is to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) sigspec.  
		If arg is absent (and there is a single sigspec) or-, each specified signal is reset to its original disposition (the value it had upon entrance to the shell).  
		If arg is the null string the signal specified by each sigspec is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.
		If arg is not present and -p has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with each sigspec are displayed.
		If no arguments are supplied or if only -p is  given,  trap  prints  the
              
              	If a sigspec is EXIT (0) the command arg is executed on exit from the shell.
		If a sigspec is DEBUG, the command arg is executed before every simple command, for, case, select command, every arithmetic for command, and before the first command  executes  in a shell function.
		If a sigspec is RETURN, the command arg is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the . or source builtins finishes executing.

              	If a sigspec is ERR, the command arg is executed whenever a simple command has a non-zero exit status, subject to the following conditions.
              		The ERR trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, 
			part of the test in an if statement, part of a command executed in a && or || list, or if the command's return value is being 
			inverted via !.  These are the same conditions obeyed by the errexit option.

              Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped, reset or listed.  Trapped signals that are not being ignored are reset  to  their
              original  values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is created.  The return status is false if any sigspec is invalid; otherwise
              trap returns true.

awk '/zzz/{match(s, r, M); print M[1]}'
	match function, returns the position in s where regular express r occurs, or 0 if not occured.
	If array M is specified, it is cleared and its 0th element contains the portion of s matched the entire RE r, its
	1st to nth elements contains portions of s matches corresponding parenthesized sub RE in r.
